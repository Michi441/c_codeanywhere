Additional information:

I fixed the issues and changed the algorithm now that i hopefully
understood the idea behind it better.
I sort just like before all cities that have direct routes to the city 
that will get destroyed (both ways).
Then, i sum the population up from all neighbor cities and for the population size i do:
newPop = (destroyedCity * neighborCity1) / sum;
neighborCity1.population = neighborCity1.population + newPop;
As required, i print now all cities out, except the destroyed one. 

It does seem to match the numbers that were given me in the email.
